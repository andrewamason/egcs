## Next Steps:

If you plan to use insurance, please email a copy of your ID and insurance card to info@egcs.health
You will receive an email from our Client Portal system called Theranest. Please create a log in and save your log in information for future appointments. Please complete all of the documentation. Our office will give you a call soon to answer any questions you may have.

To help streamline the process, please use our Insurance Verification Form. This will allow you to get an accurate understanding of your out-of-pocket costs and whether your insurance will cover part or all of the services. It's always a good idea to check with your insurance first, as coverage can vary depending on the provider and your specific plan

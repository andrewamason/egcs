{{< lead >}}For Anxiety, ADHD, Grief, Depression & More{{< /lead >}}
At our Sylvania office, we offer counseling services for individuals starting at age 4, helping them through tough emotions like anxiety, stress, ADHD, grief, behavioral problems, divorce, and depression. Our goal is to make therapy feel safe, welcoming, and effective, no matter your age. We use a range of techniques, including fun and creative approaches like play therapy for kids, as well as more structured methods for teens and adults. We currently serve Screven County and surrounding counties such as Jenkins, Burke, Bulloch, and Effingham. Our counseling services are offered in-person or virtually for all of Georgia!

## For Kids (Ages 4 and up)

Children often don’t have the words to explain how they feel, but that doesn’t mean they’re not experiencing big emotions. That’s where play therapy techniques comes in! Play is a child’s natural language, so we use things like toys, art, and games to help kids express themselves in a way that feels comfortable.

## For Teens (Ages 11-18)

Adolescence can be tough. We get it. Teens are dealing with a lot—school, relationships, figuring out who they are—and sometimes it feels overwhelming. For teens, we combine a mix of talk therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Techniques, and creative outlets to help them navigate these challenges.

## For Adults

Whether you’re struggling with anxiety, stress, depression, or grief, we’re here to listen and help you work through it. Therapy is a space for you to focus on yourself, talk things out, and gain practical tools to feel better.

## Family Support

For kids and teens, family involvement can be key. We work with parents, too, to help them understand what their child is going through and support them at home. This might include helping families improve communication or offering parenting tips for dealing with tough situations like ADHA, stress, divorce, anxiety, or grief.

## Why Choose Us?

We make counseling feel less intimidating, focusing on real-life solutions and building trust with each person. Whether you're a little one in need of some fun ways to express feelings, a teen who has desire but is lacking direction, or an adult looking to work through constant racing thoughts and self doubt, or a parent trying to help your child navigate behavioral problems, we’ve got your back.

Let’s work together to help you or your loved one feel better and live life with more confidence and peace.

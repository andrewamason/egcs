{{< lead >}}Expanding Your Knowledge in Mental Health{{< /lead >}}
At our counseling office, we offer Continuing Education (CE) opportunities for clinicians across Georgia who are eager to deepen their understanding of mental health and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. Whether you’re looking to expand your knowledge for professional growth or meet licensing requirements, we provide synchronous and asynchronous learning options that fit your busy schedule.

## What We Offer

### Synchronous (Live) Courses

Join us for live, interactive workshops where you can engage directly with instructors and other clinicians in real-time. These sessions allow for Q&A, discussion, and a more interactive learning experience. They’re perfect if you prefer live interaction and feedback.

### Asynchronous (Self-Paced) Learning

If you need more flexibility, our self-paced courses let you complete your learning at your convenience. Access materials online, work through them on your own schedule, and still earn the continuing education credits you need, without the pressure of live sessions.

### Wide Range of Topics

We cover a variety of mental health topics, including but not limited to:

- Anxiety and depression treatment techniques
- Trauma-informed care
- Ethical and legal issues in counseling
- Child and adolescent counseling strategies
- Mindfulness and self-care for clinicians
- Supervision
- Specialized topics for school counselors, private practice owners, and more!
